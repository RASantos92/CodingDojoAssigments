# REACT Dojo Datchi Hack-a-thon

```
The game's Dojodatchi
It's like a Tamagatchi
You need to feed it to survive
Gotta work so you can feed it

Cuz you know that it'd be tragic
If it somehow met it's end
I know you can code it

Oh MERN ninjas
Group into teams of
Three to four and no more than five
Oh MERN ninjas
you will compete in
Dojodatchi Hack-a-thon

Ya gotta build it in React
Make use of components
It can be any ol' theme you want
A favorite show or person

Cuz you know there's some magic
when it renders to the DOM
I know you can code it

Oh MERN ninjas
Group into teams of
Three to four and no more than five
Oh MERN ninjas
you will compete in
Dojodatchi Hack-a-thon
